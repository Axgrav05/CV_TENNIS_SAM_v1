# Tennis Match Analysis using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project uses computer vision and deep learning to analyze tennis matches. It employs YOLO for object detection, keypoint estimation for court detection, and tracking algorithms to follow player movements and ball trajectories. The final output overlays detected features and statistics on the video.

## Features
- **Tennis Ball Detection**: Uses YOLO to detect and track the ball.
- **Player Tracking**: Identifies and tracks players throughout the match.
- **Court Keypoint Detection**: Identifies court lines and calculates player positions relative to the court.
- **Shot Speed Estimation**: Calculates the velocity of shots based on ball movement.
- **Mini Court Visualization**: Displays real-time positions of players and the ball on a small overlayed court.
